Hey {name},

Welcome to Pirate Party Australia!

We're thrilled you made the decision to join us, and now that you're here, we're
even bigger and better! You should receive an invoice email along with this one.
Please contact membership@pirateparty.org.au if you don't receive it.

Our Party only exists because of the time and effort our members volunteer
towards achieving our Party's founding principles, so we want to let you know
straight away how you can get involved!

Here's some things you should do to take full advantage of your membership with
the Pirate Party:

1. Join the announcements mailing list that we use to announce all official 
party meetings and other happenings:

2. Consider joining the Party Discussion mailing list, where the Party discusses
topics relevant to the Party:

4. Drop into our chat room and say hello! We love welcoming new members, and we
can give you a helping hand with any questions you may have or assist you in
working with the party:

5. Look on the calendar for the next meeting in your area and rock up. If
there's no meeting, consider hosting one!

We host an online meeting every fortnight. The dates for this, and all other
formal events, can be found on the calendar.

6. Familiarise yourself with the party platform:

7. Check out the wiki. There is a lot of useful content on there, and it's well
worth having a look:

8. If you think you can help us out in any way, or have any questions, shoot us
an email and we'll see what we can do!

9. Consider donating! We need donations on top of membership fees to keep our
services running and run our election campaigns. Donations up to $1500 are tax
deductable!
